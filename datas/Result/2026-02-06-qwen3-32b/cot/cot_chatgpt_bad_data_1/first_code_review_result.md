- Replace list comprehension `[results.append(cache[item])]` with direct append `results.append(cache[item])` to avoid confusing side effects and adhere to style guidelines.
- Replace `eval(f"{x} * {x}")` with direct arithmetic `x * x` to eliminate critical security risks and improve performance.
- Remove unnecessary `time.sleep(0.01)` from the loop to prevent intentional performance degradation without justification.
- Avoid global variables `cache` and `results` by encapsulating state within a class or function scope to improve testability and maintainability.
