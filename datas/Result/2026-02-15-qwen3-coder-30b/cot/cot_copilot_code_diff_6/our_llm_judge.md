### Code Review Summary

- **Readability & Consistency**: Indentation is correct but lacks consistent formatting and comments.
- **Naming Conventions**: Function and variable names are unclear and not descriptive.
- **Software Engineering Standards**: Violates modularity and reusability by using globals and doing too much in one function.
- **Logic & Correctness**: Poor error handling and no return values; logic may silently fail.
- **Performance & Security**: No input validation or session cleanup; global state introduces risk.
- **Documentation & Testing**: Missing docstrings and no tests.

---

### Suggestions

- ✅ **Refactor `functionThatDoesTooMuchAndIsHardToUnderstand`** into smaller, focused functions.
- ✅ **Avoid global variables** like `GLOBAL_SESSION` and `ANOTHER_GLOBAL`; pass dependencies explicitly.
- ✅ **Use descriptive names** such as `fetch_post`, `handle_response`, etc., instead of vague ones.
- ✅ **Replace bare `except:` blocks** with specific exception types for better debugging.
- ✅ **Return results or raise exceptions** instead of printing silently.
- ✅ **Add logging or proper output handling** for production use.
- ✅ **Include docstrings and unit tests** for maintainability and clarity.

--- 

### Example Improvements

```python
# Instead of:
def functionThatDoesTooMuchAndIsHardToUnderstand():

# Use:
def fetch_and_process_posts(session: requests.Session):
    """Fetch and log post data from API endpoints."""
```

This improves clarity, testability, and reduces side effects.

First summary: 

### 📌 **Pull Request Summary**

- **Key Changes**  
  Introduces a new module `bad_requests.py` containing a single function that performs multiple HTTP operations without clear separation or error handling best practices.

- **Impact Scope**  
  Affects only the newly added file `bad_requests.py`. No existing modules impacted directly.

- **Purpose of Changes**  
  Likely an initial prototype or proof-of-concept demonstrating raw API interaction, but lacks structure and robustness for production use.

- **Risks and Considerations**  
  - Function does too much; violates single-responsibility principle.
  - Global state usage increases risk of side effects.
  - Broad exception handling hides real issues.
  - Hardcoded URLs reduce flexibility and testability.

- **Items to Confirm**  
  - Whether this is meant as a temporary PoC or will evolve into a proper service client.
  - If any tests or logging strategy exists beyond `print()` statements.
  - Whether `GLOBAL_SESSION` is intended to be reused safely in concurrent environments.

Total summary: 

 ### **Overall Conclusion**

The PR does **not meet merge criteria** due to multiple critical and high-priority issues affecting correctness, maintainability, and adherence to software engineering principles.

Blocking concerns include:
- **Violations of SRP** and **god function anti-pattern**.
- **Global state misuse** increasing risk of concurrency and side-effect issues.
- **Poor exception handling** masking bugs and reducing debuggability.
- **No return values or testability** in core logic.

Non-blocking concerns involve **readability**, **naming clarity**, and **internationalization consistency**, which can be improved without changing functional behavior.

---

### **Comprehensive Evaluation**

#### ✅ **Code Quality & Correctness**
- The main function performs multiple responsibilities (GET, POST, logging) without clear boundaries.
- Exception handling uses broad catch blocks (`except Exception`, bare `except`) leading to silent failures.
- Lack of structured output or return values prevents composability or testing.

#### ⚠️ **Maintainability & Design Concerns**
- Heavy reliance on **global variables** (`GLOBAL_SESSION`, `ANOTHER_GLOBAL`) creates tight coupling and unpredictability.
- **Magic numbers/strings** (e.g., `"200"`, hardcoded URLs) reduce flexibility and readability.
- Function name and variable names offer no semantic clarity, hindering understanding.

#### ⚠️ **Consistency with Standards**
- Formatting and naming conventions vary inconsistently across the code.
- Comments mix English and Chinese, suggesting lack of standardization.
- No formal docstrings, logging, or test coverage present.

---

### **Final Decision Recommendation**

**Request changes**  
This PR introduces unsafe and unscalable practices that violate basic software design principles. Immediate refactoring is required before merging.

---

### **Team Follow-Up**

1. **Refactor** `functionThatDoesTooMuchAndIsHardToUnderstand()` into modular components (fetch, post, log).
2. **Eliminate globals** by passing dependencies explicitly.
3. **Improve error handling** with specific exception types and logging.
4. **Standardize naming** and comment language for cross-team clarity.
5. **Add unit tests** and integration scaffolding to ensure correctness and resilience.

These actions will improve the module’s robustness and align it with production-ready patterns.

Step by step analysis: 

### 1. **No Global Assign**
**Issue**:  
Assigning to a global variable `GLOBAL_SESSION` is discouraged.

**Explanation**:  
This linter rule warns against modifying shared state outside the scope of a function or class. It makes the code less predictable and harder to test.

**Root Cause**:  
Using global variables increases coupling and side effects.

**Impact**:  
Code behavior may vary depending on how globals are initialized or changed elsewhere.

**Fix**:  
Pass dependencies explicitly instead of relying on global state.

```python
# Instead of:
GLOBAL_SESSION = requests.Session()

# Do:
def create_session():
    return requests.Session()
```

**Best Practice**: Dependency injection promotes cleaner, more modular code.

---

### 2. **Unused Variables**
**Issue**:  
The variable `ANOTHER_GLOBAL` was declared but never used.

**Explanation**:  
Unused code clutters the logic and can mislead readers into thinking something important is happening.

**Root Cause**:  
Incomplete refactoring or lack of attention during development.

**Impact**:  
Maintains confusion and reduces readability.

**Fix**:  
Remove unused declarations.

```python
# Before
ANOTHER_GLOBAL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"

# After
# Remove unused line
```

**Best Practice**: Clean up dead code regularly.

---

### 3. **Magic Numbers**
**Issue**:  
Direct usage of `200` instead of a named constant.

**Explanation**:  
Hardcoded numbers make code harder to read and maintain.

**Root Cause**: Lack of abstraction for common values.

**Impact**:  
Changes require manual updates across multiple places.

**Fix**:  
Define constants with descriptive names.

```python
# Before
if response.status_code == 200:

# After
HTTP_OK = 200
if response.status_code == HTTP_OK:
```

**Best Practice**: Replace magic values with named constants.

---

### 4. **Catch Generic Exception**
**Issue**:  
Caught exception `Exception` without handling or re-raising.

**Explanation**:  
This hides unexpected errors and prevents debugging.

**Root Cause**: Overgeneralizing exception catching.

**Impact**: Silent failures and poor observability.

**Fix**: Catch specific exceptions or log and re-raise.

```python
# Before
try:
    ...
except Exception as e:

# After
try:
    ...
except requests.RequestException as e:
    logger.error(f"Request failed: {e}")
    raise
```

**Best Practice**: Handle known exceptions gracefully and propagate unknown ones.

---

### 5. **Empty Except Block**
**Issue**:  
An empty `except` block swallows all exceptions silently.

**Explanation**:  
Such blocks hide bugs and make diagnostics impossible.

**Root Cause**: Incomplete error management.

**Impact**: Masked runtime errors.

**Fix**: Log or raise exceptions.

```python
# Before
except:
    pass

# After
except Exception as e:
    logger.exception("Unexpected error occurred")
    raise
```

**Best Practice**: Never ignore exceptions.

---

### 6. **Console Logs**
**Issue**:  
Use of `print()` makes testing and deployment difficult.

**Explanation**:  
Print statements tie output to console and aren’t suitable for production systems.

**Impact**: Limits flexibility and traceability.

**Fix**: Use structured logging instead.

```python
# Before
print("Response received")

# After
import logging
logger.info("Response received")
```

**Best Practice**: Prefer logs over prints for better control.

---

### 7. **Long Function**
**Issue**:  
One function handles too many unrelated tasks.

**Explanation**:  
Violates the Single Responsibility Principle.

**Impact**: Difficult to debug, extend, or reuse.

**Fix**: Decompose into smaller, focused helpers.

```python
# Before
def complex_function():
    # Fetch, process, log, post...

# After
def fetch_data():
    ...

def send_post():
    ...

def log_result():
    ...
```

**Best Practice**: Each function should do one thing well.

---

### 8. **Implicit Boolean Check**
**Issue**:  
Using `== 200` instead of checking `response.ok`.

**Explanation**:  
Less readable and not idiomatic for HTTP responses.

**Impact**: Misleading comparisons.

**Fix**: Prefer standard properties like `.ok`.

```python
# Before
if response.status_code == 200:

# After
if response.ok:
```

**Best Practice**: Leverage built-in response attributes when available.

## Code Smells:
### Code Smell Type: 
**God Function / Function Does Too Much**

- **Problem Location:**  
  `functionThatDoesTooMuchAndIsHardToUnderstand()`  

- **Detailed Explanation:**  
  This function violates the Single Responsibility Principle by performing multiple unrelated tasks: making HTTP GET requests, printing responses, handling exceptions, and sending a POST request. It's hard to understand, test, and reuse because it does not focus on one core behavior.

- **Improvement Suggestions:**  
  Split into smaller, focused functions:
  - One for fetching data via GET.
  - Another for posting data.
  - A third to handle logging/printing results.
  - Each should have clear inputs/outputs.

- **Priority Level:**  
  High

---

### Code Smell Type: 
**Global State Usage**

- **Problem Location:**  
  `GLOBAL_SESSION = requests.Session()` and `ANOTHER_GLOBAL = "https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"`

- **Detailed Explanation:**  
  Using global variables makes code harder to reason about and increases coupling. It can lead to side effects and non-deterministic behavior when the module is used in different contexts or during parallel execution.

- **Improvement Suggestions:**  
  Pass dependencies explicitly rather than relying on globals. For example, inject session object and base URLs where needed instead of defining them globally.

- **Priority Level:**  
  High

---

### Code Smell Type: 
**Poor Exception Handling**

- **Problem Location:**  
  `except Exception as e:` and bare `except:` clauses

- **Detailed Explanation:**  
  Catching broad exceptions like `Exception` hides actual errors, making debugging difficult. Bare `except:` blocks prevent proper error propagation and mask issues silently.

- **Improvement Suggestions:**  
  Catch specific exceptions (e.g., `requests.RequestException`) and log meaningful messages or re-raise appropriately after handling known cases.

- **Priority Level:**  
  High

---

### Code Smell Type: 
**Magic Strings / Hardcoded Values**

- **Problem Location:**  
  `"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1"`, `"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts"`, `"foo"`, `"bar"`, `1`

- **Detailed Explanation:**  
  These values make the code brittle and hard to maintain. If any URL or payload changes, you must manually update every instance. They also reduce readability since context isn't clear without additional knowledge.

- **Improvement Suggestions:**  
  Extract these into constants or configuration files for better clarity and easier modification.

- **Priority Level:**  
  Medium

---

### Code Smell Type: 
**Unclear Naming**

- **Problem Location:**  
  `functionThatDoesTooMuchAndIsHardToUnderstand()`, `weirdVariableName`

- **Detailed Explanation:**  
  Function name gives no indication of its purpose. Variable names are ambiguous and do not reflect their role or content.

- **Improvement Suggestions:**  
  Rename functions and variables to describe what they do and hold. Example: `fetch_post_and_log_response()` and `response`.

- **Priority Level:**  
  Medium

---

### Code Smell Type: 
**Lack of Return Values / Side Effects Only**

- **Problem Location:**  
  All operations print directly; nothing returned for further processing or testing.

- **Detailed Explanation:**  
  Functions that only perform side effects are hard to test and compose. Separation of concerns improves modularity and testability.

- **Improvement Suggestions:**  
  Return structured data (like parsed JSON) from functions so consumers can act upon it. Print statements should be left to callers or dedicated logging systems.

- **Priority Level:**  
  Medium

---

### Code Smell Type: 
**Inconsistent Logging / Debugging Output**

- **Problem Location:**  
  Mixed use of English and Chinese messages (`狀態碼`, `回應文字`, `第二次請求成功`, etc.)

- **Detailed Explanation:**  
  Inconsistent language usage reduces professionalism and makes internationalization harder. Also affects readability across teams using different languages.

- **Improvement Suggestions:**  
  Standardize message format and localization strategy (e.g., externalized strings). Use consistent English unless locale-specific support is required.

- **Priority Level:**  
  Low
