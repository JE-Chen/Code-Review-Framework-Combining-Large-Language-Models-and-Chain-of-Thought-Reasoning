Five evaluation dimensions:
### 1. Readability
    - 1–20: Comments are very hard to understand, poorly structured, confusing language.
    - 21–40: Some parts are readable, but many unclear sections remain.
    - 41–60: Comments are generally clear, but structure or phrasing needs improvement.
    - 61–80: Comments are well-structured, consistent, and easy to follow.
    - 81–100: Comments are highly readable, elegantly phrased, and well-organized.

### 2. Constructiveness (Maintainability)
    - 1–20: Comments lack constructive suggestions, no improvement direction.
    - 21–40: Comments provide partial suggestions, but vague or impractical.
    - 41–60: Comments offer basic improvement ideas, somewhat helpful.
    - 61–80: Comments are specific and actionable, clearly guiding improvements.
    - 81–100: Comments are highly constructive, offering clear and practical improvement paths.

### 3. Correctness
    - 1–20: Comments contain errors or misleading advice.
    - 21–40: Mostly correct, but important issues are overlooked.
    - 41–60: Largely correct, with only minor gaps.
    - 61–80: Correct and reasonable, with small room for refinement.
    - 81–100: Fully correct, logically sound, and precise in identifying issues.

### 4. Multi-Review Coverage, Structural Independence & Extractability

    > Evaluate how well the comments cover important issues across multiple review reports, and whether each comment block is structurally independent, self-contained, and understandable on its own.
    
    #### Scoring Criteria
    
    - **1–20**  
      Rarely addresses important issues; structure is disorganized; comments heavily depend on surrounding context; blocks cannot be read independently; unclear linkage to specific code smells or linter messages.
    
    - **21–40**  
      Addresses some issues but misses many key points; unclear boundaries between sections; frequent cross-references required for understanding; difficult to isolate specific issue blocks.
    
    - **41–60**  
      Covers many important issues; basic structure is present; some blocks can be read independently, but certain sections still rely on context or lack completeness.
    
    - **61–80**  
      Most key issues are addressed; comment blocks are clearly structured with defined themes; most sections can be independently read and understood (problem + reasoning + suggestion); code smell / linter-related blocks are reasonably extractable.
    
    - **81–100**  
      Thoroughly addresses key issues; each comment block is **independent, complete, and self-contained** (including problem description, impact explanation, and actionable improvement suggestions);  
      clearly segmented structure; any block can be extracted without losing meaning;  
      strongly aligned with specific code smells or linter messages; highly readable and maintainable.
    ---
    ### Additional Evaluation Criteria
    
    When scoring this dimension, explicitly check whether each comment block:
    - Has a clear title or thematic focus  
    - Clearly identifies the issue source (e.g., specific code smell or linter message)  
    - Explains impact or risk  
    - Provides concrete and actionable improvement suggestions  
    - Does not rely on other sections for comprehension  
    
    Also assess whether:
    - A single comment block can be extracted and shared independently without losing clarity  
    - Code smell or linter-related sections can be isolated for structured analysis  
    - Summary sections and detailed comments are clearly distinguished  

### 5. Comprehensiveness

### Code Review Summary

#### 1. **Readability & Consistency**
- **Indentation and Formatting**: Indentation is consistent and readable.
- **Comments**: No inline comments; could benefit from brief explanations for complex logic blocks.
- **Naming**: Some variable names like `MAGIC`, `STRANGE_FLAGS` are unclear. Consider more descriptive names.

#### 2. **Naming Conventions**
- **Vague Names**:
  - `PLAYER`, `ENEMIES`, `BULLETS`: While functional, these are generic and can be improved by using classes or more specific naming.
  - `STRANGE_FLAGS`: Unclear purpose; rename to something like `game_state_flags`.
  - `MAGIC`: Should be replaced with a named constant (e.g., `SPAWN_INTERVAL`).
- **Function Name**: `do_the_whole_game_because_why_not()` is humorous but not descriptive; consider renaming to something like `run_game_loop()`.

#### 3. **Software Engineering Standards**
- **Modularity**: The entire game logic is in one large function (`do_the_whole_game_because_why_not`). This reduces reusability and testability.
- **Duplicate Logic**: Movement boundaries are checked multiple times. Could be abstracted into helper functions.
- **Exception Handling**: The bare `except:` clause suppresses all exceptions — dangerous and should be replaced with specific exception types or removed.

#### 4. **Logic & Correctness**
- **List Mutation During Iteration**: Modifying lists (`ENEMIES`, `BULLETS`) during iteration can cause issues. Using `[:]` avoids some problems, but it's better to refactor into separate loops.
- **Boundary Checks**: Redundant checks for player position clamping (repeated four times). Can be simplified.
- **Collision Detection Bug**: The nested loop for bullet-enemy collisions removes items from the list being iterated over, which may lead to skipping elements.

#### 5. **Performance & Security**
- **Performance Issues**:
  - Drawing every object each frame without optimization.
  - Inefficient collision detection due to nested loops.
- **Security Risks**: None detected in current context; however, input validation isn't a concern here since no external inputs are processed directly.

#### 6. **Documentation & Testing**
- **Documentation**: No docstrings or inline comments explaining key functions or sections.
- **Testing**: No unit or integration tests provided. This makes maintaining and extending the code difficult.

#### 7. **Suggestions for Improvement**
- Rename `MAGIC` to `SPAWN_INTERVAL`.
- Replace `STRANGE_FLAGS` with a clearer name such as `GAME_STATE`.
- Refactor movement logic into reusable functions.
- Break down `do_the_whole_game_because_why_not()` into smaller, focused functions.
- Avoid bare `except:` clauses.
- Improve collision detection with optimized algorithms (e.g., spatial partitioning).
- Add docstrings and comments for clarity.

#### ✅ Overall Rating: ⚠️ Moderate Quality
The code works but has room for significant improvement in terms of structure, clarity, and maintainability.

First summary: 

### **Pull Request Summary**

- **Key Changes**  
  - Implemented a basic PyGame-based arcade-style game with player movement, enemy spawning, bullet firing, collision detection, and scoring.
  - Added health and panic mechanics tied to enemy collisions and score milestones.

- **Impact Scope**  
  - Entire `main.py` file contains all game logic.
  - Affects rendering, input handling, physics simulation, and game state updates.

- **Purpose of Changes**  
  - Introduces a functional prototype of a simple shooter game for demonstration or further development.

- **Risks and Considerations**  
  - Use of bare `except:` may hide critical errors; potential performance issues due to list copying in loops.
  - Collision detection uses approximate thresholds, which could lead to inconsistent gameplay.
  - Game loop assumes fixed frame rate; no dynamic timing adjustment.

- **Items to Confirm**  
  - Ensure proper exception handling instead of generic `except:`.
  - Validate collision logic and boundary checks for robustness.
  - Confirm that game balance (enemy speed, bullet spread) is suitable for intended gameplay.

---

### **Code Review Feedback**

#### **1. Readability & Consistency**
- ✅ **Indentation & Formatting**: Code is consistently indented using 4 spaces.
- ⚠️ **Comments & Naming**: Comments are minimal and mostly informal ("why not", "totally fine"). While humorous, they reduce professionalism. Prefer descriptive inline comments where necessary.
- 🛑 **Variable Names**: Some variables like `W`, `H`, `MAGIC`, `STRANGE_FLAGS` lack clarity. Consider renaming them for better understanding (e.g., `SCREEN_WIDTH`, `SCREEN_HEIGHT`, `SPAWN_INTERVAL`, `GAME_FLAGS`).

#### **2. Naming Conventions**
- ❌ **Poorly Named Variables**:
  - `MAGIC`: Unreadable magic number. Should be replaced with a named constant.
  - `STRANGE_FLAGS`: Vague name. Could be renamed to something like `GAME_STATE` or `PLAYER_STATUS`.
  - `do_the_whole_game_because_why_not`: Too casual and unclear. Rename to `run_game_loop()` or similar.

#### **3. Software Engineering Standards**
- ❌ **Duplicate Logic**: In `try/except` block, removing items from lists during iteration can cause index issues. Using slices (`ENEMIES[:]`) avoids mutation during iteration but doesn't prevent race conditions or logic flaws.
- ⚠️ **Global State Management**: Heavy reliance on global variables makes testing difficult and increases coupling.
- 🧩 **Refactor Opportunity**: Extract key behaviors into functions (e.g., `update_player_position`, `handle_collisions`, `spawn_enemies`) for modularity and readability.

#### **4. Logic & Correctness**
- ⚠️ **Collision Detection**: Uses bounding box approximation (`abs(x1 - x2) < threshold`). This may miss hits or register false positives depending on object sizes.
- ⚠️ **Frame Counter Usage**: The use of `frame_counter % 300 == 0` for resetting panic flag is arbitrary and not well-documented.
- ❌ **Exception Handling**: Bare `except:` blocks suppress all exceptions silently — this can mask bugs and make debugging harder.

#### **5. Performance & Security**
- ⚠️ **Performance Bottleneck**: Iterating over `ENEMIES[:]` and `BULLETS[:]` repeatedly inside nested loops can degrade performance as entities increase.
- 🔐 **Security Risk**: No input sanitization or validation (though limited to local gameplay). If extended to user inputs or network data, would require additional checks.

#### **6. Documentation & Testing**
- ⚠️ **Lack of Docstrings**: No docstrings or inline documentation explaining function purposes or parameters.
- ⚠️ **No Unit Tests**: There are no tests for game logic or state transitions. Suggest adding unit tests for core systems (movement, collision, scoring).

#### **7. Overall Observations**
- The code works as a proof-of-concept but lacks polish and scalability. It’s suitable for learning or prototyping but not production-ready without major refactoring.
- Encourage modular design and clear naming conventions to improve long-term maintainability.

---

### **Recommendations**
1. Replace `MAGIC` with a descriptive constant.
2. Rename vague identifiers (`STRANGE_FLAGS`, `do_the_whole_game_because_why_not`) for clarity.
3. Refactor large sections into smaller, reusable functions.
4. Replace `except:` with specific exception types.
5. Add docstrings and unit tests.
6. Improve collision detection logic with proper distance checks or AABB comparisons.

Total summary: 

 ### **Overall Conclusion**
The PR does **not meet merge criteria** due to several **high-priority issues** that affect correctness, maintainability, and safety. Key concerns include unsafe exception handling, magic numbers, global state misuse, and poor code structure. These issues pose risks to stability and future extensibility.

### **Comprehensive Evaluation**

#### **Code Quality and Correctness**
- **Critical Logic Flaws**: 
  - Bare `except:` clause on line 65 suppresses all exceptions, masking bugs and making debugging difficult.
  - List modification during iteration in collision detection (lines 51–55, 58–60) can lead to skipped elements or runtime errors.
- **Magic Numbers and Constants**:
  - Multiple hardcoded values (`17`, `10`, `15`, `300`) are used without clear meaning or naming, causing reduced readability and maintainability.
- **Incorrect Boundary Checks**:
  - Player boundary checks are duplicated and incorrectly implemented (e.g., `if PLAYER["x"] > W: PLAYER["x"] = W` instead of clamping).

#### **Maintainability and Design Concerns**
- **Global State Abuse**:
  - Heavy use of global variables (`PLAYER`, `ENEMIES`, `BULLETS`, `STRANGE_FLAGS`) reduces modularity and testability.
- **Violation of SRP**:
  - The function `do_the_whole_game_because_why_not()` performs too many responsibilities, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Duplicated Code**:
  - Redundant boundary-checking logic appears in multiple locations.
- **Poor Naming Conventions**:
  - Function and variable names like `MAGIC`, `STRANGE_FLAGS`, and `do_the_whole_game_because_why_not` lack clarity and semantic meaning.

#### **Consistency with Existing Patterns**
- No adherence to standard Python naming conventions (snake_case for variables, PascalCase for classes).
- Lack of structured approach (e.g., classes, modules) contradicts common software engineering best practices seen in larger projects.

### **Final Decision Recommendation**
**Request changes**  
The PR introduces a functional prototype but includes **critical structural and safety flaws**:
- Unsafe exception handling (`except: pass`)
- Inefficient list iteration with mutation
- Use of magic numbers and global state
These issues significantly hinder long-term maintainability and risk instability. Refactoring is required before merging.

### **Team Follow-up**
1. **Refactor Game Logic**: Break `do_the_whole_game_because_why_not()` into smaller, focused functions.
2. **Eliminate Global State**: Encapsulate game state into a class structure to improve testability and reduce coupling.
3. **Replace Magic Numbers**: Define named constants for all hardcoded values.
4. **Improve Error Handling**: Replace bare `except:` with specific exception types or logging.
5. **Add Documentation**: Include docstrings and inline comments for key logic blocks.
6. **Optimize Collision Detection**: Investigate alternatives to nested loops for better performance.
7. **Remove Unnecessary Sleep**: Eliminate `time.sleep(1)` before exit to avoid blocking behavior.

Step by step analysis: 

### 1. **Unused Variable (`no-unused-vars`)**
**Issue:**  
The variable `MAGIC` is declared on line 15 but never used in the scope. This can confuse developers and clutter the codebase.

**Root Cause:**  
This likely happened due to an incomplete refactoring or temporary placeholder left behind during development.

**Impact:**  
It reduces readability and introduces technical debt—unused code should be removed to keep the project clean.

**Fix:**  
Remove the unused variable entirely.
```python
# Remove this line:
# MAGIC = 17
```

**Best Practice:**  
Always remove dead code. Use tools like linters to detect unused variables early.

---

### 2. **Magic Number (`no-magic-numbers`)**
**Issue:**  
A magic number `17` is used directly in the code without explanation or naming.

**Root Cause:**  
Hardcoding values makes assumptions implicit, reducing maintainability and clarity.

**Impact:**  
Future developers won’t understand what `17` represents unless they trace back through logic.

**Fix:**  
Define it as a named constant.
```python
SPAWN_INTERVAL = 17
...
if spawn_timer > SPAWN_INTERVAL:
```

**Best Practice:**  
Replace magic numbers with descriptive constants to make intentions clear.

---

### 3. **Implicit Boolean Check (`no-implicit-boolean-check`)**
**Issue:**  
Using modulo comparison like `frame_counter % 10 == 0` to control bullet firing isn't very expressive.

**Root Cause:**  
Code readability suffers because the intent isn't immediately obvious.

**Impact:**  
Makes code harder to read and modify for new developers.

**Fix:**  
Extract into a helper function.
```python
def should_fire_bullet(frame_count):
    return frame_count % 10 == 0

# Then in your condition:
if should_fire_bullet(frame_counter):
    ...
```

**Best Practice:**  
Use descriptive helper functions for complex conditions.

---

### 4. **Duplicate Code (`no-duplicate-code`)**
**Issue:**  
Boundary checks for player movement appear twice in different locations.

**Root Cause:**  
Redundant logic due to lack of abstraction or shared utility functions.

**Impact:**  
Changes must be applied in multiple places, increasing risk of inconsistencies.

**Fix:**  
Create a reusable function.
```python
def clamp(value, min_val, max_val):
    return max(min_val, min(max_val, value))

# Replace repeated checks:
player_x = clamp(player_x, 0, screen_width)
```

**Best Practice:**  
Apply DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle by extracting common logic into utilities.

---

### 5. **Try/Except Pass (`no-try-except-pass`)**
**Issue:**  
An empty `except: pass` block hides all exceptions silently.

**Root Cause:**  
Poor error handling that masks real problems and prevents debugging.

**Impact:**  
Can lead to silent failures, making troubleshooting difficult.

**Fix:**  
Handle specific exceptions or log them.
```python
try:
    # some risky operation
except IndexError as e:
    print("Index error occurred:", e)
```

**Best Practice:**  
Never ignore exceptions. Always either handle them properly or raise them up.

---

### 6. **Hardcoded Colors (`no-hardcoded-colors`)**
**Issue:**  
RGB values like `(0, 200, 0)` are scattered throughout the code.

**Root Cause:**  
No centralization of visual settings leads to inconsistency.

**Impact:**  
Changing colors requires searching across many lines.

**Fix:**  
Define color constants.
```python
GREEN = (0, 200, 0)
RED = (200, 50, 50)
```

**Best Practice:**  
Group related constants together for easier updates and consistency.

---

### 7. **Hardcoded Sizes (`no-hardcoded-sizes`)**
**Issue:**  
Dimensions like `20`, `10`, `4` are hardcoded in various places.

**Root Cause:**  
Inflexible design where visuals depend on arbitrary numbers.

**Impact:**  
Scaling or changing sizes becomes cumbersome and error-prone.

**Fix:**  
Use named constants.
```python
PLAYER_SIZE = 20
ENEMY_RADIUS = 10
BULLET_RADIUS = 4
```

**Best Practice:**  
Centralize configuration data to support easy customization.

---

### 8. **Global Mutable State (`no-global-mutable-state`)**
**Issue:**  
Variables like `PLAYER`, `ENEMIES`, `BULLETS` are global and mutable.

**Root Cause:**  
Tight coupling between components makes testing and modification harder.

**Impact:**  
Testing becomes difficult, and side effects propagate unpredictably.

**Fix:**  
Refactor to use classes.
```python
class GameEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.player = {}
        self.enemies = []
        self.bullets = []

    def update(self):
        ...
```

**Best Practice:**  
Minimize use of global state. Prefer encapsulation via classes or modules.

---

### 9. **Inconsistent Naming (`no-inconsistent-naming`)**
**Issue:**  
Function name `do_the_whole_game_because_why_not` lacks clarity.

**Root Cause:**  
Unprofessional naming reflects poor attention to detail.

**Impact:**  
Confusing for anyone trying to understand or extend the code.

**Fix:**  
Rename function to be more descriptive.
```python
def run_game_loop():
    ...
```

**Best Practice:**  
Use clear, meaningful names that describe what a function does.

---

### 10. **Unreachable Code (`no-unreachable-code`)**
**Issue:**  
The final `time.sleep(1)` and `sys.exit()` after `pygame.quit()` may not execute reliably.

**Root Cause:**  
Early exits can bypass cleanup code, causing improper shutdown.

**Impact:**  
Program termination might be inconsistent or delayed unnecessarily.

**Fix:**  
Ensure cleanup happens before exiting.
```python
pygame.quit()
# Do any required cleanup here
sys.exit()
```

**Best Practice:**  
Order cleanup operations logically and ensure they always run.

---

These fixes will significantly improve code structure, readability, and long-term maintainability. Let me know if you'd like a full refactored version!

## Code Smells:
---

### Code Smell Type: Magic Numbers
**Problem Location:**  
Line 23: `MAGIC = 17`  
Line 34: `if frame_counter % 10 == 0:`  
Line 39: `if spawn_timer > MAGIC:`  
Line 54: `if abs(e["x"] - b["x"]) < 10 and abs(e["y"] - b["y"]) < 10:`  
Line 59: `if abs(e["x"] - PLAYER["x"]) < 15 and abs(e["y"] - PLAYER["y"]) < 15:`  
Line 65: `if PLAYER["score"] % 5 == 0:`  
Line 71: `if frame_counter % 300 == 0:`  

**Detailed Explanation:**  
The use of hardcoded numeric values (magic numbers) makes the code less readable and harder to maintain. These values are not self-documenting and could easily change without clear indication of their purpose or meaning. This hinders future modifications and reduces code clarity.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
Replace these magic numbers with named constants at the top of the file or within a configuration module. For instance:
```python
SPAWN_INTERVAL = 17
BULLET_FIRE_RATE = 10
COLLISION_THRESHOLD = 10
ENEMY_COLLISION_THRESHOLD = 15
SCORE_INCREMENT = 5
PANIC_DURATION = 300
```

**Priority Level:** High

---

### Code Smell Type: Global State Usage
**Problem Location:**  
Lines 11–14, 17–19, 22, 25–26, 32, 35–37, 43–45, 50–52, 57–60, 63–64, 67–69, 73–74, 76–78, 81–82  

**Detailed Explanation:**  
The game uses global variables (`PLAYER`, `ENEMIES`, `BULLETS`, `STRANGE_FLAGS`) extensively, which violates encapsulation principles and makes testing difficult. Changes to one part of the state can have unintended side effects on other parts of the system, leading to hard-to-debug issues.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
Refactor the game into classes such as `Player`, `Enemy`, `Bullet`, and `GameEngine`. Use instance attributes instead of global dictionaries. This promotes modularity, testability, and separation of concerns.

**Priority Level:** High

---

### Code Smell Type: Inconsistent Naming Conventions
**Problem Location:**  
Variable names like `PLAYER`, `ENEMIES`, `BULLETS`, `STRANGE_FLAGS`, `MAGIC`, `CLOCK_THING`, `FONT`, `W`, `H`  

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Names like `PLAYER`, `ENEMIES`, and `STRANGE_FLAGS` are inconsistent in naming style. Some are uppercase (indicating constants), others are lowercase. The term `STRANGE_FLAGS` is misleading and does not clearly indicate its purpose. Also, `MAGIC` doesn't describe what value represents — this leads to confusion.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
Follow snake_case for variables (`player`, `enemies`, `bullets`, `flags`, `spawn_interval`) and use descriptive names that reflect their roles. Constants should be uppercase with underscores (`SPAWN_INTERVAL`, `BULLET_SPEED`, etc.).

**Priority Level:** Medium

---

### Code Smell Type: Duplicated Logic
**Problem Location:**  
Lines 39–42 and lines 57–60 both check boundaries using similar conditional logic for player movement.  

**Detailed Explanation:**  
There's repeated code for boundary checking (e.g., clamping x/y coordinates). While small, duplication increases maintenance cost when changes need to be applied in multiple places.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
Create a helper function to clamp values between min and max bounds. E.g., `clamp(value, min_val, max_val)` to simplify the checks.

**Priority Level:** Medium

---

### Code Smell Type: Exception Handling Without Specificity
**Problem Location:**  
Line 50: `except: pass`  

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Using bare `except: pass` catches all exceptions silently, hiding potential bugs or errors during execution. It prevents debugging and may mask serious issues like index errors from removing items during iteration.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
Avoid catching all exceptions. Instead, catch specific ones where necessary or better yet, restructure the loop logic to avoid modifying lists while iterating.

**Priority Level:** High

---

### Code Smell Type: Tight Coupling Between Components
**Problem Location:**  
All major components (`PLAYER`, `ENEMIES`, `BULLETS`) are tightly coupled through direct access via global variables.  

**Detailed Explanation:**  
This tight coupling makes it hard to isolate functionality for testing or extend behavior later. If any component changes, nearby components may also require updates due to shared dependencies.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
Encapsulate data and behavior inside objects (classes). Create methods for updating positions, collisions, rendering, etc., so interactions happen through well-defined interfaces rather than raw data access.

**Priority Level:** High

---

### Code Smell Type: Poor Loop Design with List Modification During Iteration
**Problem Location:**  
Lines 51–55 and 58–60  

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Iterating over a list (`ENEMIES[:]`, `BULLETS[:]`) and modifying it simultaneously causes unpredictable behavior and is inefficient. Modifying lists during iteration often results in skipping elements or runtime errors.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
Use separate loops for detection and removal, or use list comprehension techniques for filtering. Alternatively, iterate forwards or backwards carefully and manage indices manually.

**Priority Level:** High

---

### Code Smell Type: Unnecessary Sleep Before Exit
**Problem Location:**  
Line 83: `time.sleep(1)`  

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Adding a delay before exiting the application feels like a hack rather than proper cleanup. It’s unnecessary and blocks the thread unnecessarily, especially since the program ends anyway after quitting Pygame.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
Remove the sleep call unless there's a valid reason for waiting (e.g., showing a final message). Otherwise, simply quit cleanly.

**Priority Level:** Low

---

### Code Smell Type: Lack of Documentation
**Problem Location:**  
No docstrings or inline comments explaining key functions or logic  

**Detailed Explanation:**  
Without inline documentation or docstrings, understanding the flow and intent behind certain sections becomes challenging. Especially in games, clear comments help maintainers understand how physics, scoring, and timing work.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
Add docstrings for main functions like `do_the_whole_game_because_why_not()` and inline comments for complex logic blocks. For example:
```python
def update_player_position():
    """Updates the player's position based on keyboard input."""
```

**Priority Level:** Medium

---

### Code Smell Type: Violation of Single Responsibility Principle
**Problem Location:**  
Function `do_the_whole_game_because_why_not()` handles initialization, input processing, collision detection, rendering, game state management, and exit logic all in one place.  

**Detailed Explanation:**  
This function attempts to do too many things, violating the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP). SRP suggests each function should handle only one kind of task. Mixing input, logic, rendering, and control flow reduces readability and makes testing harder.

**Improvement Suggestions:**  
Break down `do_the_whole_game_because_why_not()` into smaller, focused functions such as:
- `handle_input()`
- `update_game_state()`
- `check_collisions()`
- `render_scene()`
- `manage_game_loop()`

Each would be responsible for a distinct aspect of the game mechanics.

**Priority Level:** High
