Mergeable: No

Reason Summary: Major functional changes are introduced in the PR that may cause the functionality to change or alter the existing functionality.

Detailed Analysis:
1. The PR contains a significant number of improvements and fixes. However, it also includes minor issues and suggestions for improvement. These minor issues could lead to a loss or alteration of intended functionality.
2. The code does not follow the established coding standards and conventions. It has a high cognitive complexity and lacks clear and well-structured comments.
3. The PR also contains a few minor issues and suggestions for improvement. The code quality and maintainability can be improved by addressing these issues.

Risk Assessment: High

Recommendations:
1. The PR should be refactored and improved before merging to ensure that the code is well-structured, thoroughly tested, follows the established coding standards and conventions, and does not introduce any major functional changes or alterations.
2. The code should be reviewed and tested thoroughly to ensure that the changes do not introduce any new errors or bugs.
3. The PR should be reverted or discarded if the improvements are not feasible or not justified.
4. The PR should be split into smaller, more manageable pieces to reduce the cognitive complexity and improve code readability.
5. The PR should be reviewed by a team of experienced developers to ensure that the changes do not introduce any potential merge conflicts or side effects.
