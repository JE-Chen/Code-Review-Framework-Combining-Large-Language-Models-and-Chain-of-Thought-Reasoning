PR is of sufficient quality to be merged into the main branch. However, it would be better to include the PR description, code diff and test results for better understanding.

Improvement Suggestions:

1. Add more detailed test cases to cover more edge cases and exceptions.
2. Improve the documentation to explain the code better.
3. Consider adding more checks to ensure the file has not been modified in the middle of reading to prevent the errors from being signaled.
